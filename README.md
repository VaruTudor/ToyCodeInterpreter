Bellow I added a manual execution where I explain step by step<br>
what is happening.<hr>
This are the two windows at start: on the left the selection of a program<br>
to run and on the right each state can be viewd in detail:<br>
-1st box - program states<br>
-2nd box - heap<br>
-3rd box - console (prints can be viewd here)<br>
-4th box - table of variables<br>
-5th box - statement

After program selection, on the other window the only program state is selected.<br>
On the bottom all statements can be seen in execution order.

After a fork statement, a new program state is created (simulating different processes)<br>
and at each step both program states advance one step.

Once the execution is finished, the user is informed with a pop-up window.
